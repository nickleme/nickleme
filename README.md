## 

Trying to figure out my place on the internet, developing games at [Studio Bravarda](https://studiobravarda.com/) and open to new opportunities.

Over the past 8 years, I've been gathering experience in the indie game space, successfully launching games on Steam, Switch and Google Play Store. I intimately understand the indie development cycle and have extensive experience working on games from the first prototype to completion within small remote teams and tight deadlines.

In roles ranging from Creative Director to Engineering Team Lead, I've honed my expertise in gameplay programming. Whether crafting weapons, designing enemies, or optimizing inventory systems, gameplay remains my focus. I just love developing systems that transport the player to a new reality.
